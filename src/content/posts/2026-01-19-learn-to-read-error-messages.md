Stack traces are gifts. Read them.

Most error messages tell you exactly what's wrong. File, line number, the specific exception. Everything you need to start debugging.

Yet developers skim them, search for solutions, copy-paste fixes from Stack Overflow. Slow down. The computer is trying to help you.

```javascript
import sys
// Code blocks work with syntax highlighting
console.log("Hello, World!");
```

Understanding errors teaches you the system. Each stack frame is a layer of abstraction peeling back. Follow the trail to the root cause.
