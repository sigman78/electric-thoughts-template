Stop guessing. Start bisecting.

The most effective debugging technique is binary search. Git bisect for regressions. Comment out half the code. Isolate the problem systematically.

Write your assumptions down. You're usually wrong about where the bug is. Rubber ducking works because explaining reveals gaps in understanding.

Bugs live in the boundary between what you think the code does and what it actually does. Close that gap with data, not intuition.
