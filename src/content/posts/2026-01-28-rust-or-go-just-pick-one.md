Stop debating and start shipping. Both languages are fast, safe, and production-ready. Rust gives you zero-cost abstractions and memory safety. Go gives you simplicity and fast compile times.

Choose Rust for systems programming, game engines, or when you need fine-grained control. Choose Go for network services, CLIs, or when you need to onboard developers quickly.

The best language is the one your team can write confidently. Performance differences rarely matter compared to developer velocity and maintainability.
